                            <p>This project began as a redesign for the movie poster for "I Am Ali" and blossomed into a three part poster series. This series features three of the most famous boxers in history. The quotes pulled for the project are suppose to be inpirational to boxers while being fun to look at.</p>

                            <p>This is a redesign of a past logo that I made up for a class project. The company name had to include an animal so I chose a turtle and made the company's background to be a surf shop. I enjoyed the rebranding process for I was not pleased with the first run at it. It portrays a calming beach like feeling to match that of a turtle.</p>
